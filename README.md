# Project Title: Image Classification with Keras

## Overview
This project is designed to demonstrate the capabilities of deep learning in image classification tasks. Using a dataset (e.g., dogs vs. cats), the project employs various neural network architectures to classify images. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction stages.

## Features
- Data processing with NumPy and Pandas.
- Image extraction and preprocessing using OpenCV.
- Implementation of convolutional neural networks with Keras and TensorFlow.
- Model training with real-time data augmentation.
- Evaluation of model performance using accuracy and loss metrics.
- Prediction on new, unseen images.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- Keras

## Installation
Instructions for setting up the project environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/qqmath/keras-cat-dog
pip install numpy pandas opencv-python tensorflow keras
```

## Dataset
The dataset used for training is the "Dogs vs. Cats Redux: Kernels Edition" from Kaggle.
